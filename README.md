# Spacecraft-Control-Center-Mirror
 
Many people are familiar with the iconic photographs of NAS and NASA-contracted engineers sitting at consoles during the launch of space flight vehicles, or interacting with the International Space Station (ISS) from the control center in Houston, TX. This project will create a small-scale simulated version of a control center for use in testing and training of students in the Space Flight Operations degree program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach (ERAU-DB) campus. The simulated Spacecraft Control Center Testing and Training Environment (STaTE) will allow students to monitor and control individual systems within a simulated spacecraft in order to learn through hands-on experience the techniques and challenges of console operations. The simulated system will allow a test conductor to present the console team with off-nominal spacecraft behavior to give students practice in trouble-shooting and recovering from vehicle component deviations and failures. 

Members of the control team will rehearse specific scenarios representing typical spacecraft housekeeping or mission functions. The control team will be provided with procedures through which spacecraft functions may be exercised. In some testing/training scenarios the test conductor may present off-nominal behaviors or conditions to the control team so they may rehearse troubleshooting and recovery procedures. 

Project uses Python 3.11.0, utilizing the Django 4.1.6 framework and SQLite database.
